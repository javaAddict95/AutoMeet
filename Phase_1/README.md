# AutoMeet - Proposal


This folder provides the files related to the previous submission, which is the proposal phase. 

The solution developed from the initial idea includes two parts: the metadata and the AI parts. The metadata is extracted using an API, and the AI part focuses on extracting time from the videos using the OCR Model (Optical Character Recognition). To know the time in the video synchronized with the time of the match, as the time of the events extracted from the data does not match the time of the video. Also, the timer disappearance coincides with significant events such as missed attacks, which are not mentioned in the data extracted from search engines.
